        <h1>Who was Salvador Dalí?</h1>
        <p>
          Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech, Marquess of Dalí of
          Púbol (11 May 1904 - 23 January 1989) was a Spanish surrealist artist
          renowned for his technical skill, precise draftsmanship, and the
          striking and bizarre images in his work. Born in Figueres, Catalonia,
          Spain, Dalí received his formal education in fine arts in Madrid.

          Influenced by Impressionism and the Renaissance masters from a young
          age he became increasingly attracted to Cubism and avant-garde
          movements. He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined
          the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading
          exponents. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was
          completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist
          paintings.

          Dalí lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939)
          before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved
          commercial success. He returned to Spain in 1948 where he announced
          his return to the Catholic faith and developed his "nuclear mysticism"
          style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism, and recent
          scientific developments.
